		<h3>First Post 27JAN2021</h3>
		<p>For me, I'd say my best in-class moment as a CS major was probably during systems II when we made the Y86 simulator. It was a pretty large challenge, but at the end when we finished I felt very accomplished and knew that I could deal with any other challenge put before me (with enough time of course). My best outside-of-class moment I think was about my junior year of highschool. I had an interest in CS but knew basically nothing about it. I took a class on Visual Basic, and used that to build a small calculator to help me compare costs of colleges. It was nothing very impressive, but it was the very first thing I had built myself that served a purpose, and it helped show me that I really did want to dive deeper into the field.<br/><br/></p>

		<h3>Ethics Discussion Reflection</h3>
		<p>There was one main take-away for me from the discussion as a whole, a theme that I saw in most, though not necessarily all of the class' description of how they get their ethics. What I noticed what that generally, every individual's ethics were fluid, and would change over time or over situation. There were general principles in place that other's would follow, and I could infer that there were certain lines that would not be crossed. But I counted multiple times where someone would say something alluding to "gray areas" that were open to interpretation. As someone who does believe in an absolute right and wrong in every situation, this sentiment that I foud common took me by suprise. I do not wish to cast this is a negative light however, and there is always the possibility that I misinterpreted what was said. This was simply an observation I made, and the one that stuck with me the most from the conversation.
