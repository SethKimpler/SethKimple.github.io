		<h3>First Post 27JAN2021</h3>
		<p>For me, I'd say my best in-class moment as a CS major was probably during systems II when we made the Y86 simulator. It was a pretty large challenge, but at the end when we finished I felt very accomplished and knew that I could deal with any other challenge put before me (with enough time of course). My best outside-of-class moment I think was about my junior year of highschool. I had an interest in CS but knew basically nothing about it. I took a class on Visual Basic, and used that to build a small calculator to help me compare costs of colleges. It was nothing very impressive, but it was the very first thing I had built myself that served a purpose, and it helped show me that I really did want to dive deeper into the field.<br/><br/></p>

		<h3>Ethics Discussion Reflection 3FEB21</h3>
		<p>There was one main take-away for me from the discussion as a whole, a theme that I saw in most, though not necessarily all of the class' description of how they get their ethics. What I noticed what that generally, every individual's ethics were fluid, and would change over time or over situation. There were general principles in place that other's would follow, and I could infer that there were certain lines that would not be crossed. But I counted multiple times where someone would say something alluding to "gray areas" that were open to interpretation. As someone who does believe in an absolute right and wrong in every situation, this sentiment that I foud common took me by suprise. I do not wish to cast this is a negative light however, and there is always the possibility that I misinterpreted what was said. This was simply an observation I made, and the one that stuck with me the most from the conversation.</p>

		<h3>Reflection: Hive Tracks/Bee Informed Partnership Case Study 19FEB21</h3>
		<p>For me, the most interesting part about the study was when we had the conversations on intellectual property. It just shocked me how messy it could get so easily. While I had thought a fair bit before about how multiple people and entities could all make claims to the same product, I had not really thought about what it meant to actually own it. That's why I enjoyed talking more about what the differences were between copyrights, patents, trademarks, and tradesecrets. It was good to see the reasonsing for why there are different types of ownership of intellectual property. As CS majors especially, I think it was extrememly beneficial to talk about the types of contracts employers may have you sign relating to this. Being aware of what personal intellectual property rights you may be signing away to a company is a huge deal, and definitely something one would want to be aware of before it had the chance to become an issue. I guess it just comes down to attention to detail and not signing anything before fully reading and understanding it.</p>

		<h3>Blockchain Discussion 24MAR21</h3>
		<p>The discussions on blockchain opened up my eyes to the possibilities that the technology presents. I'd only ever knew it in relation to Bitcoin and other cryptos, thinking it was just a 'cyber-currency'. However, it can be used for so much more. Things like monitoring supply chains is a huge area that it can and is being implemented in. Also monitoring records of things like vehicles to prevent tampering or modification. One of the things that I found most interesting was how it can be used to store a person's entire medical records. Blockchain would allow them access to individual pieces, such as pulling up an ID or a past blood test, without opening up the entire record. Overall, the discussion helped me realize what a bright future blockchain has, as it can be implemented in most any area of our life.</p>

		<h3>Final Presentation Topics</h3>
		<p>One presentation that I'm looking forward to is the one on reasons why people may not want to get the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a very current issue, and one that I'm curious to see another person's position on. I think there are many angles that can be taken on it, but particularly I'm interested to see if it's a subjective or objective approach taken on the issue. I'm not really sure the two can be seperated in this case, however I'm looking forward to seeing how it is tackled.</p>
