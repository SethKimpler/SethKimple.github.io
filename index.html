		<p>For me, I'd say my best in-class moment as a CS major was probably during systems II when we made the Y86 simulator. It was a pretty large challenge, but at the end when we finished I felt very accomplished and knew that I could deal with any other challenge put before me (with enough time of course). My best outside-of-class moment I think was about my junior year of highschool. I had an interest in CS but knew basically nothing about it. I took a class on Visual Basic, and used that to build a small calculator to help me compare costs of colleges. It was nothing very impressive, but it was the very first thing I had built myself that served a purpose, and it helped show me that I really did want to dive deeper into the field.<br/><br/></p>
